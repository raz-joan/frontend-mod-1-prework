After reading about four particular methods on the MDN documentation, I described them below ...

   1. `pop` this method will remove the last item in an array, so it also decreases the length of the array by one. Syntax: `arrayName.pop();`

   2. `push` this method will add a new item to the end of an array, so it also increases the length of the array by one. Syntax: `arrayName.push(data);`

   3. `shift` this method will remove the first item in an array and shift items so that each item's index is one less than it was previously. it also decreases the length of the array by one. Syntax: `arrayName.shift();`

   4. `unshift` this method will add a new item to the beginning of an array and shift all previously existing items up by one index number. it also increases the length of the array by one. Syntax: `arrayName.unshift(data);`
