## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

    My workflow felt slightly different. I had already installed a pomodoro timer to help me take breaks with more frequency and consistency, however reading about the method helped me to feel more convinced of it. I did find that I pushed to stay focused longer and avoided distractions from my workflow better. I do believe that I worked more efficiently too - so more work done faster, just like the method says!


2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

    Setting intentions (AND writing them down) helped me to stay more focused. I was surprised that tasks actually felt more approachable. I was able to pretty accurately estimate the time it would take to complete different tasks. Even in cases when I needed to google a problem/question, it helped me to know how much time to put in and to not get distracted while googling. Overall, the intention setting, in addition to the timer, made this practice seem more productive/manageable/efficient.


3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

    An object is similar to an array in that it can hold and organize lots of data, however it is more complex in nature. An array is just an ordered list, in which different data is accessed according to its index number, or position in the list of data. An object is organized and stored differently: you create key-value pairs such that you can access a particular key that holds data. In addition, you can define many properties in the constructor, and then also write methods (functions) that will allow you to do something to the data or with the data!


4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - An array would be better because this is a list of similar items.
  * List of states and their capitals
    - An object would be better because this also includes a relationship within data in the list.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - An array would be better because this is a list of similar items.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - An array would be better because this is a list of similar items.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - An object would be better because this also includes a relationship within data in the list.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - An object would be better because this also includes a relationship within data in the list.
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - An array would be better because this is a list of similar items.

5. In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

    Another possible illustration of an object used in a web application would be a 'loaned book' on your 'shelf' in a library app. The object would be 'loanedBook' with *properties* like: author, title, dueInDays, hoursListened, and hoursRemaining. Some of these properties would /change/ over time, so you would need object *methods* to alter the data so that it will correctly display the days until it is due, as well as knowing how many hours you have listened to and how many remain.

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

    I am honestly just unsure at this time. I'm sure they will arise during Mod1!
